### Artist’s Statement

This experience aims to **honor the mythological source texts** while exploring new possibilities in storytelling. By letting Aeneas and Odysseus share a metaphysical space, the project blurs time and epic traditions, bringing to light shared themes of duty, grief, and identity. The format enables users to engage with ancient literature in an emotionally resonant and visually dynamic way.
