## *Voices from the Underworld* â€” Interactive Mythological Narrative

### Overview

This project is an interactive **choose-your-own-adventure-style experience** based on *The Odyssey* (Book 11) and *The Aeneid* (Book 6), where the mythological journeys of Odysseus and Aeneas through the Underworld converge due to a divine anomaly. Through an immersive narrative interface, users explore character interactions, dialogue, and textual references grounded in Greco-Roman epic literature.

---

### Objectives

* **Reimagine canonical mythology** through a creative digital medium.
* **Visualize character dialogue** using speech bubbles and dynamic illustrations.
* **Compare and contrast** Homeric and Virgilian views of the Underworld.
* **Incorporate ecocritical and psychological depth**, focusing on memory, grief, and legacy.

---

### Features

* **Narrative crossover**: A mythically-justified intersection of *Odyssey* and *Aeneid* underworlds
* **Dynamic character dialogue**: Speech bubbles rendered with images for Dido, Sibyl, Tiresias, Achilles, Anticlea, Anchises, and others
* **Role of the gods**: Apollo, Hecate, and Persephone sanction the metaphysical breach
* **Audio integration ready**: Each scene optionally plays a corresponding `.mp3` voice clip
* **Classical art background**: A dramatic, fixed Underworld painting sets the tone
* **Scholarly references**: Direct quotes from Homer and Virgil with citations for each soulâ€™s dialogue

### Artistâ€™s Statement

This experience aims to **honor the mythological source texts** while exploring new possibilities in storytelling. By letting Aeneas and Odysseus share a metaphysical space, the project blurs time and epic traditions, bringing to light shared themes of duty, grief, and identity. The format enables users to engage with ancient literature in an emotionally resonant and visually dynamic way.
