            <p><strong>Narrator (at the edge of the pit):</strong></p>
            <p><em>Setting the mythic stage where timelines blur.</em></p>
            <p>Aeneas and Odysseus meet in the Underworld through divine anomaly. While Aeneas journeys with the Sibyl (*Aeneid* 6) and Odysseus seeks Tiresias's prophecy (*Odyssey* 11), their paths mysteriously converge.</p>
            <p>A breach in time—where Lethe's waters cross the blood pit—draws both heroes into the same mythic space. This convergence is no accident. It is sanctioned by Persephone, manipulated by Apollo and Hecate, and opens a liminal gateway where the living can see across destinies.</p>
            <p>At the edge of the pit of blood, the two heroes meet—silent, wary, respectful. Their eyes lock. The dead stir.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="slide">
            <p><strong>Odysseus (standing guard beside the blood pit):</strong></p>
            <p>He spots Aeneas approaching through the gloom, accompanied by the Sibyl.</p>
            <p><strong>"How didst thou dare to come down to Hades…?"</strong> (*Odyssey* 11.474)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="slide">
            <p><strong>Aeneas (at the boundary of Tartarus, guided by the Sibyl):</strong></p>
            <p>Unfazed, he steadies himself for the crossing.</p>
            <p><strong>"Begin thy journey! Now, all thy courage!"</strong> (*Aeneid* 6.261)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="slide">
            <p><strong>Narrator (as shadows swirl nearby):</strong></p>
            <p>From deeper within the Fields of Mourning, a shape stirs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="slide">
            <p><strong>Dido (emerging from a grove of sorrowful shades):</strong></p>
            <p>She locks eyes with Aeneas, then turns away. Her words are bitter and restrained.</p>
            <p><strong>"Not by choice I fled thy shores…"</strong> (*Aeneid* 6.456)</p>
            <p>Her <strong>"frowning brow… changeless flint."</strong> (*Aeneid* 6.469)</p>
            <p>She disappears into the shadows, unhealed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="slide">
            <p><strong>Odysseus (quietly, puzzled):</strong></p>
            <p>Watching her depart, he leans toward Aeneas.</p>
            <p><strong>"Who was she?"</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="slide">
            <p><strong>Sibyl (near the gates of Dis, flame in hand):</strong></p>
            <p>She turns sharply, sensing the threads of fate twisting unnaturally.</p>
            <p><strong>"The downward path is easy for mortal feet. But to retrace thy steps… Few, favored by the gods, may win that grace."</strong> (*Aeneid* 6.128–131)</p>
            <p>She steps between them and warns: <em>This convergence disturbs the order. Shadows are stirred who should not yet speak. The price of prophecy may be memory itself.</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="slide">
            <p><strong>Tiresias (rising from the steaming pit of blood):</strong></p>
            <p>Drinking from the dark offering, he looks upon both heroes.</p>
            <p><strong>"Give place from the pit and draw back thy sharp sword…"</strong> (*Odyssey* 11.95)</p>
            <p><strong>"New Achilles now in Latium breathes…"</strong> (*Aeneid* 6.89)</p>
            <p><strong>"Thou shalt find woes in thy house, though thou escape the sea."</strong> (*Odyssey* 11.114)</p>

        <div class="slide">
            <p><strong>Narrator (as the mist curls across the path):</strong></p>
            <p>Another figure takes form from memory's veil.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="slide">
            <p><strong>Anticlea (hovering near the boundary of the pit):</strong></p>
            <p>Pale and trembling, she steps into view before her son.</p>
            <p><strong>"It was longing for thee… that robbed me of honey-sweet life."</strong> (*Odyssey* 11.200)</p>
            <p>Her voice fades as she recalls Penelope, Laertes, and Ithaca—now distant and dim.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="slide">
            <p><strong>Achilles (at the far edge of the Field of Heroes):</strong></p>
            <p>He turns to face them, his armor dulled in the shadow realm.</p>
            <p><strong>"I would rather serve another man as a field-hand… than be lord of all the dead."</strong> (*Odyssey* 11.488–491)</p>
            <p>He shakes his head. <em>"The glory of arms is hollow in this realm."</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="slide">
            <p><strong>Anchises (in the Elysian Fields, walking among future souls):</strong></p>
            <p>He spots Aeneas and greets him warmly, then notices Odysseus nearby.</p>
            <p><strong>"I cherished long this hope… What perils manifold assailed thee…"</strong> (*Aeneid* 6.687)</p>
            <p>He gestures toward the shade of Marcellus.</p>
            <p><strong>"Behold Marcellus… if thou evade thy evil star…"</strong> (*Aeneid* 6.884)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="slide">
            <p><strong>Narrator (as the air begins to fracture):</strong></p>
            <p>The Sibyl's torch dims. The spell unravels. Time collapses inward.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="slide">
            <p><strong>Sibyl (firmly, raising her arm):</strong></p>
            <p>She gestures toward the Gates of Sleep.</p>
            <p><strong>"Now Sleep has portals twain… One of horn, and one of ivory. Through ivory let him rise."</strong> (*Aeneid* 6.893)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="slide">
            <p><strong>Narrator (final parting):</strong></p>
            <p>The breach closes. The pit dries. Aeneas and Odysseus part, carrying with them echoes not meant for mortal minds.</p>
